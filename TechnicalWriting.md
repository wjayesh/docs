## Introduction

This document is a one way discourse that takes up the idea of technical writing and casually discusses the decisions that are made and the thought
that goes into writing an article. This is **not** an absolute guide in itself; part of the skill in writing articles is researching your agenda and this document
serves to warm you up just enough to take up the challenge on your own.


## Motivation

Why should you write an article? Take a while to answer that question.

Once you've spent some time on it, you'll realise that writing is much more than just sharing your expertise. It's an exercise that allows you 
to put thoughts that you had floating around in your head, into an order. In the context of this very document, the possession of a skill is valued, granted, but
the ability to convey that information in a comprehensible fashion is desired widely in the industry. 

* Think of a situation when you're working on a team and need help from your coworkers on a bug you discovered. How do you go about detailing your problem
such that all useful information is presented in a concise way? This is important because you don't have eternity, neither do those who are interested in 
your problem (or in some cases, your genius solutions). 

* Having hundreds of people read articles about your project is also going to earn your Github repositories some star-gazers and that is unarguably a great
thing to have. Moreover, people in the field will get to know you and your work. You never know when an opportunity might knock your door. 

Technical writing helps you achieve all of that and the skills go a long way to assist your career and relations. 

## What Should You Write About

Thinking of a topic to write an article on is a daunting task, I agree. There are so many options and you feel like you have ample to share 
about the things you work on.

</p>

The usual advice would be to document the projects you build; be it the technical side of things or the experience as a whole. Digging deeper, 
however, you'll realise that there's a plethora of articles online that deal with just that and given the finite number of tech stack options, you 
can comfortably anticipate multiple collisions where your article is vastly similar to those around.

* Identifying parts of your project that stand out is the key here. Think about the challenges you faced while building the product; not your run of the mill
errors that you looked up on Stack Overflow but the circumstances that make your problem somewhat unique. 

  For an example, the first article I [wrote](https://medium.com/flutter-community/going-from-scratch-to-a-full-blown-flutter-app-in-two-days-c06f1d1a1975?source=your_stories_page---------------------------) 
  on Medium was about a hackathon I participated in, on my own. I had built an [app](https://github.com/wjayesh/companion-beta) using Flutter, a technology 
that I learnt just a week back. The idea that drove me to write an article was not the concept of the app but the experience; the wide range of things I 
encountered as a newbie on Flutter amidst a competition and what I did to solve them within the given time, without another human assisting me.  

* Another indicator of identifying whether you should cover a topic is finding out whether extensive offical documentation exists for the problem
you're trying to solve. If there is a good body of work for it, then the topic is a hard pass. Look for the unexplored corners of the tech world;
combination of technologies that seem seemingly useful but for which you find almost no tangible resources online. 

  Maybe there's a conference video on youtube that deals with it, a talk perhaps, but no detailed tutorial. That's when you know you have a very 
eligible candidate to put your expertise down about. 

### An exercise

Try searching for "Flutter Azure authentication" on Google and send me an email (or an IG dm) telling me what you see in the results.

</p>

A helpful side benefit of this method is you get motivated to try new things out. You'll agree with me that implementing a solution you saw on a tutorial is 
fun only when you're just starting out. Once you have some grip on the technology, it's time for adventures. These look great on your resume(if they make it there;
kudos if they don't iykwim). 

## What Platform To Choose

I started out on Medium and have seen good numbers on that site with many of my articles. Although it is a good place to start, I would
recommend checking out `dev.to`. The scope of this website is much narrower in that it deals with software developers primarily. There are a bunch of
awesome engineers on the site and you get to learn a lot of tricks from their writings. 

However, this doesn't mean that you ditch Medium altogether. Remember the greater reach you have with your articles, the better. Why not publish them on both?
You may also leverage your LinkedIn connections and [publish](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-get-started-programming-part-i-jayesh-sharma) articles there too!


## How Should You Write

It would be a bummer if after all that I've said above I resort to copying points from a hundred wonderful articles on the internet that are available
with a simple search. What I'll do instead is link a few resources that I found very useful. This, in itself, is a thoughtful tip. Use the articles you find
online that talk about your agenda, in a way that improves upon them. Discover the unique touch that you can lend to the existing work. It is guaranteed that 
you'll be able to do so because ultimately everyone has a story to tell. Yours different from mine. 

### Resources

Feel free to open a PR if you stumble upon a brilliant article and want others to benefit from it too!

* [Flutter Community Guidelines](): This is an extremely well written article that I referenced when I started.
* [Technical writing tips](https://dev.to/iriskatastic/writing-technical-articles-tips-for-programmers-29gp) from dev.to : Concise but covers all aspects.
